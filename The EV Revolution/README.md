## Data Sources  
- U.S. Department of Energy — Alternative Fuels Data Center  
  [https://driveelectric.gov/stations](https://driveelectric.gov/stations)

## Tools Used  
- Python (`shapely`, `pandas`)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Canva (for layout and annotation)  
- **ChatGPT** (for design guidance)

## Project Description  
This project presents a geographic data visualization of the EV charging network across the United States. The infographic includes a map showing the spatial availability of EV chargers using radii of 4, 20, and 100 miles to demonstrate coverage. It supports a broader argument advocating for electric vehicle adoption.

### What?
A custom-built map shows overlapping service areas of charging stations across the country. Additional infographic elements explain how widespread charger availability improves convenience, affordability, and accessibility.

### Why?
The biggest concerns preventing consumers from switching to EVs include *range anxiety*, infrastructure doubts, and perceived cost. This project helps dispel those concerns by visualizing how charger access has expanded and continues to improve.

### How?

#### Data & Mapping
- Downloaded EV station data from the U.S. Alternative Fuels Data Center  
- Used Python and shapely to create a layered radius map around each station  
- Grouped data by coverage distance:
  - *4-mile radius* (urban convenience)
  - *20-mile radius* (suburban access)
  - *100-mile radius* (highway and rural travel confidence)

#### Design & Presentation
- Exported the map
- Added supporting visuals and annotated boxes to explain key arguments
- Designed a unified infographic layout to strengthen persuasive impact

## Features Summary (Markdown Highlights)
- *Visual map showing real-world EV infrastructure coverage*  
- **Color-coded radius zones for charger proximity**  
- **Clear takeaways addressing EV accessibility, cost, and growth**
