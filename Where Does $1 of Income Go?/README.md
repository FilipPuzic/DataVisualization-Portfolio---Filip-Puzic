## Project Description  
This project visualizes how U.S. household spending varies dramatically based on income level, comparing households earning under $50K with those earning over $200K. It aims to highlight income-based disparities in financial flexibility and priorities.

### What?
The visualization includes two pie charts side-by-side showing percentage breakdowns of household spending by category for low-income and high-income groups. The chart also includes summary insights to guide the reader.

### Why?
As income inequality grows, understanding how different groups allocate their limited resources is essential for informed policy and personal finance decisions. This visualization shows how lower-income households spend most of their money on essentials, while higher-income households have more room for long-term planning and saving.

### How?

#### Data Analysis
- Pulled and cleaned U.S. BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey data (2022–2023)
- Calculated spending shares by category for the two income brackets
- Grouped expenses into broader categories like *Essentials* and *Financial Commitments*

#### Design & Presentation
- Built pie charts to represent both household types visually
- Added descriptive highlights and color-coded groupings for quick understanding
- Designed a cohesive, clean infographic layout to emphasize key takeaways
