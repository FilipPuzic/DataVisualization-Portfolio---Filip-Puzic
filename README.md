# Data Visualization Portfolio

## About Me

Welcome to my data visualization portfolio! I’m Filip Puzic, a student with a strong interest in data, economics, and design. I enjoy working with data to reveal trends, patterns, and insights that are easy to understand and visually compelling.

I have experience with Python, data cleaning, and visualization using tools like Plotly, Folium, Matplotlib, Canva, and Recraft. Whether it's through charts, maps, or infographics, I focus on making data easier to understand and more impactful.

I'm especially interested in topics related to finance and sustainability, and I hope to build a career where I can use data to drive smart, effective decision-making.

## Project 1: Recreate and Remix — S&P 500 Candlestick Visualization

<table align="left" style = "border-collapse: collapse; border: none;">
    <tr style = "border: none;">
        <td style="padding: 10px; width:25%; border: none;">

            <p>
            This project involved recreating a financial candlestick chart from TradingView using Python and Plotly, then remixing it with added insights and interactivity. I enhanced the visualization with technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands, a 200-day moving average, and OHLC tooltips to make it more informative and user-friendly. <a href="./Remix/README.md">Learn more</a>

## Project 2: The EV Revolution — Why It’s Time to Go Electric

<table align="left" style = "border-collapse: collapse; border: none;">
    <tr style = "border: none;">
        <td style="padding: 10px; width:25%; border: none;"> 
            <img src="./Images/EV Map Blue copy.png"  alt="EV Revolution" >

            This infographic explores the geographic spread of EV charging infrastructure in the U.S. using layered radius maps. It argues for the viability of switching to electric vehicles by visualizing access to chargers within 4, 20, and 100-mile radii. This project combined mapping, spatial data, and clean design to support a data-driven argument for electrification. <a href="./The EV Revolution/README.md">Learn more</a>

## Project 3: Where Does $1 of Income Go?

<table align="left" style = "border-collapse: collapse; border: none;">
    <tr style = "border: none;">
        <td style="padding: 10px; width:25%; border: none;"> 
            <img src="./Images/Consumer-Spending.png" alt="Income Spending" >
        </td>
        <td style="padding:10px; width:75%; border: none;" valign = "top">
            <p>
            This project visualizes how average U.S. households earning under $50K and over $200K allocate each dollar of income. By using pie charts and concise commentary, it highlights stark contrasts in spending priorities and financial flexibility between income groups. The visual helps users quickly grasp how essentials dominate low-income budgets, while high earners can afford more saving and planning. <a href="./Where Does $1 of Income Go?/README.md">Learn more</a>
